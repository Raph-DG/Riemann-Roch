# Algebraic Cycles

In this file we define algebraic cycles on a scheme to be functions into the integers with locally
finite support. Throughout this file, and indeed this project, we use height in the specialization
order for dimension and coheight for codimension. For this to work nicely, we really need things to
be catenary. We do not define this notion in this file (at the time of writing this) since we do
not need it here, but this will be needed when one wants to relate dimension and codimension to
eachother via the topological krull dimension of the scheme.

Much of the algebraic structure on cycles is already defined happily, so here we just define the
notion of the pushforward of algebraic cycles, and define the notion of a "principal cycle",
which is just a witness for rational equivalence. We show that these principal

Proof of concept, but this is a mildly insane way to write this I think.

The idea is we want to compute the order of vanishing of a mermorphic section of a line bundle.
On an integral scheme, a meromorphic section is just a section of the constant sheaf
of value F.stalk (genericPoint X).

The idea is we should have that for any x : X,
F.stalk (genericPoint X) ‚âÖ (F.stalk x) ‚äó X.functionField. This should be induced by the fact that
the constant sheaf F.stalk (genericPoint X) is ùí™.stalk (genericPoint X)

      Since f is an element of the function field, it is equivalently given by a section of ùí™À£(U)
      for some nonempty open subset U (this should be more or less by definition, but of course there
      may be some API to develop here connecting up the different equivalent ways of talking
      about function fields). Well, I suppose technically f should correspond to ùí™(U) for some U,
      and then we can further specialise to where f has no zeros, again this depends on how things
      are set up slightly.

      Then, in U f has no zeros or poles, which is a lemma we should prove. This means that the
      points where f has zeros or poles must occur within X \ U. This X \ U is a proper closed
      subset of X since U is nonempty, meaning that any point in X \ U has codimension at most 1,
      (since, such a point is a specialization of the generic point, which is not in U). Hence,
      any prime divisor where f has nontrivial order of vanishing must be an irreducible component
      of X \ U.

      But we know that since X is locally Noetherian, any closed subset has finitely many
      irreducible components, and so we win.

Given a family of closed subschemes of X (represented as an Œπ indexed collection of closed immersions
W i from B i to X) which is locally finite, we define a principal cycle to be a cycle expressed as
the sum of the pushforwards of div (f i), where f is a family of rational functions on (B i).

        U is a set around z which intersects finitely many of the subvarieties on which we're
        computing the rational equivalence.

        Let c_i be the pushforward of div (f i) along W_i. On U, z meets finitely many c_i. And
        we know that for all i, we can construct a neighbourhood V_i of z such that V_i instersects
        c_i in finitely many places.

        The idea is to take the finitely many i meeting U, and so take the intersection of all the
        V_is and U. Call this new set T. T intersects finitely many c_i since it is a subset of U.
        Further, every c_i intersects T in finitely many points since we took an intersection, so
        we should be done.

        One thing to note is that if there are no such c_i meeting U, then T will be an intersection
        over the empty set, i.e. univ.

We want a theorem saying if two divisors are linearly equivalent then we can just check this by
checking if their difference is principal.

Note that here we are not actually using the fact that the morphisms in our family are closed immersions.
I think we'll need this in theorems and to make sure that this is indeed an equivalence relation however.

We now have some notion of algebraic cycles on a scheme, and we have some
properties which let us discuss rational equivalence (more or less)

Define :-
  Algebraic cycles :-
  - Graded pieces (probably using dimension function stratification)
  - Specialisation to the case of divisors (linear equilavence & so on)
  - Characterisation in cases we care about as free abelian group of prime divisors (instead of
    the more bulky general definition we have now)
  - Characterisation in case of curves as divisors being sums of points

  Invertible sheaves:-
  - Invertible sheaves
  - Defining the Picard group of invertible sheaves
  - Rational sections of sheaves
  - Existence of rational sections on (at least) integral schemes
  - Weil divisor associated to an invertible sheaf
  - Showing that the map previously defined is a homomorphim
  - Showing when this map gives an isomorphism between the picard group and the divisor class group
  - Definition of O_Y for Y ‚àà X.

  Cohomology:-
  For Riemann-Roch, we only need the following:
  - The Euler Characteristic of a sheaf
  - Proof that the Euler characteristic is additive
  - Above requires long exact sequence associated to a sheaf
  - Cohomology of skyscraper sheaf

  Things to note:
  - One can feasibly do this without developing Cech cohomology, by showing
    the skyscraper is flasque and that the
  - It's unclear to me whether we need some notion of Serre vanishing for a
    form of the Euler characteristic formula. I think it should still hold,
    since the rank-nullity theorem still holds in this case. That said,
    the meaning of the infinite sum would still be a bit mysterious.
    Possibly best to do this with Serre finiteness, which ought to fall
    out of Cech cohomology definition almost immediately
  - One thing is, we could define the Euler characteristic for the case we need to be
    h0 - h1. Then, to prove this notion of EC is additive, we just need to show Serre vanishing
    for curves. I think agian this is easiest to do w/ Cech cohomology.
  Cech Cohomology:
  - Cech cohomology with respect to a cover
  - Show that a curve always has an affine cover with two pieces
  - Compute cohomology of a skyscraper by taking an affine cover
    with 1 open containing supported point
  -
  -

Could define :-
  - Axiomitisation of intersection form - might be good if we want to do
    asymptotic RR
