Theorem: Given a separated scheme, any open affine cover will give the same
Cech cohomology value.

Note that being separated is not necessary here, the reason we have it is because
it allows us to not need to check anything about the open cover. This also works
for an arbitrary scheme where we have an affine cover such that all intersections
of the cover are also affine (which is immediately implied by X being separated)

We now in princial have the Cech cohomology of a quasicoherent sheaf as something we can
mess around with

Now, to avoid proving too much about cohomology, it might be best to phrase Riemann
Roch as h^0(X, L(D)) - h^1(X, L(D)) = deg D + h^0(X, L(D)) - h^1(X, L(D))

So, here we need a notion of h^1 (i.e. the dimension of the corresponding vector space)

In other words, we need that over a field k we have that our Abelian group is a k-vector
space.

I'm a little worried we may want Serre finiteness. For this, I think, it might
be better just to prove it in the special case of line bundles on curves.

Noting that the pushforward preserves cohomology because
we have a closed subset (Hartshorne III 2.10), so if we can prove the result for
P^n we get our result. But we can classify line bundles on P^n by combinatorial
means, so we should be able to push this through.

The only problem is



In this case, we know any curve is covered by two open affines and since we're assuming
a lot about what a curve is, we can apply our above theorem to say that the
cohomology of our line bundle can be computed with respect to this cover.

What we'd really like is for our line bundle to trivialise on such a cover,
then we'd have that on

Then, we need to show that
