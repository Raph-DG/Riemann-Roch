# Cech cohomology

In this file we define a skeleton of the lemmas we need about Cech cohomology.
Since this is currently being developed by Kenny Lau, we're mainly treating this
as a black box for the time being.

As such, this will be the least developed of the files for some time, and we will
only update thsi file as we need lemmas or definitions in the statement and proof of
Riemann-Roch.

A stand in for the Euler characteristic of a sheaf F on a space, defined as:
œá(F) = ‚àë (i : ‚Ñï), (-1)^i h^i(X, F).

This is currently just a black box that produces an integer given a sheaf F. Currently it's
definitely at the wrong level of generality.

This is for a couple of reasons. For one, for Riemann Roch we're only going to be concerned with
the truncated Euler Characteristic `h‚Å∞ - h¬π`. This will avoid having to prove Serre finiteness.

This should also potentially not be a notion which is dependant on the
sheaf of rings (and it probably also shouldn't be dependant on the Grothendick topology). It's
also unclear this should take in a sheaf of modules at all. Indeed, the Cech cohomology is defined
