# Weil Divisors

In this file we define the notion of Weil divisors and construct the sheaf 𝒪(D), defining it on U
to be rational functions such that (f) + D ≥ 0 on U.

This definition gives good results on Noetherian, integral separated schemes which are regular in
codimension 1. Since our main goal is proving Riemann Roch for curves this should be enough power
for us, but we should in the future extend these results.

This definition is currently sorried because I'm not sure if I always want to assume that
the schemes we're talking about are nonempty (which the typesignature of this definition
implicitly assumes). This is mainly just here to make statements relating the dimension
and codimension cleaner to state.

This is a slightly nonstandard definition of what it means to be catenary, and it is
mainly stated here because we will need this assumption to show that principal divisors
(defined with respect to the coheight) are indeed divisors (i.e. cycles of dimension n-1).

This should be a concrete definition of `𝒪(D) ⊗ 𝒪(D')` (though I have no reference for this so
it's possible this is a mistake). I think this is more or less
what we would get from just using the notion of sheafification for prelocal properties. However,
this API is written in terms of concrete functions, and here we have elements of the function
field.

What I like about this definition is the elements are just elements of the function field,
which makes me think we could have a really nice notation for multiplying sections which
plays nicely with the tensor product basically for free. That said, this might also be painless
if we just use the tensor product of sheaves of modules on the nose (this, however, does not
exist at the time of writing without a bit more work).

What's the argument here?

We know that if the divisors are equal, then for every z in X, we have that
ordFrac (stalk z) f = ordFrac (stalk z) g, which we know implies that
f = u • g for some u a unit in stalk z.

This all should imply there is some u which is a unit in every stalk, so we should
be able to get a unit globally. I think this is true.
We need to show that this implies there is some unit u in Γ(X, ⊤) s.t. f = u • g.

We can now define what we mean by 𝒪(D + D') = 𝒪(D) ⊗ 𝒪(D'). I believe this should be an equality

    This part is a bit more tricky. Given a section `s` of `𝓞(D + D')`, we need to show that for any
    `z : X`, there is a neighbourhood around which `s = f*g`, where `f` and `g` are sections of
    `𝒪(D)` and `𝒪(D')` respectively.

    In order to do this, we probably need that all local rings are UFDs.
    This implies that there is some neighbourhood `U` around `z` where `s` is of the form `(h)|ᵤ`
    for some rational function `h`. We also know in this context that all prime divisors of `U`
    are just given by the prime ideals of `U`, and that these are all principal.
    So we can factorise our rational function `h` using  the generators of these ideals.

    It is necessary to get this nhd where we have something precisely principal. For example, if
    we take X to be the projective line, D = -(0), D' = (0), then we want to work in U = X \ {∞}
    so that we can guarantee that (x) + D ≥ 0 (since otherwise it would have a pole).

    Suppose a = x, f = 2/x and g = x^2. Then, f*g = 2x, which has the same vanishing as a but is
    not a.

    Suppose ord (f/g) = ord (h/k) ↔ ord f - ord g = ord h - ord k.


    In a fraction ring over a UFD, elements have a reduced fraction form (meaning the numerator
    and denominator are relatively prime). I claim that these reduced fractions must differ by the
    algebra map of a unit. If this is true, then we can take reduced fractions of `a` and `f*g`
    to get that `a = u*(f*g)`, and so we can take `u*f` for our first function and `g` for our
    second (or vice versa). This I think will prove our result.

            This may not be true, so I don't think we can use f and g on the nose. However, I think
            it's true that a and f*g can only differ by multiplciation by a unit.

            So we want some lemma saying (f) = (g) ↔ <f> = <g>. However, what precisely do we mean
            by this? Potentially we want to say that f and g differ by scalar multiplication by
            an element of `Γ(X, V)` (where `V` is the set where all these things are defined).

            I doubt it, since in an affine nhd, we certainly can't multiply by any function without
            changing the order of vanishing.

            I think we need to show the existence of an actual regular function, and we need U1 and
            U2 to be affine. The problem is, if we need to do this then this method doesn't work,
            since this would


            At this point we know that (a) = (f * g), and I claim that this should mean that this
            must mean that there is some u1 and u2 such that a = u1*f * u2*g. So we need to come
            up with even more order of vanishing api I think.




            We know that for any z, ord f z = ord g z implies f and g differ by a unit in R
            in the local ring at R. We now need to lift that to something global.

            I'm wondering if we even need it in all local rings. E.g. if we have in the stalk
            at z that f = u • g, can this just be lifted globally?

      is a sheaf, meaning that for any open cover U_i of X, if I have that local sections s_i
      for each U_i agreeing on overlaps, I can just patch it into a big thing.

      This should be simple because a section over any of these is just a rational function,
      and they should all be the same rational function. So this just amounts to verifying
      that on the big set s + D ≥ 0, which is true since s is just s_i on each U_i (and we're
